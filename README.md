  Link to The code repository is dead so I am unable to proceed with this assesment, however, here is how I would go about it from a high level overview:
 
1) High‑Level Review
Code Quality Score (1–10):  
Rationale: Stack choice is appropriate for an AI Q&A app. Without source access, we are working on an assumption of a basic but workble structure, typical of a first iteration, with room for testing, typing, and deployment hardening.

Production Readiness:  
Core surfaces missing in many first submissions: auth, observability, robust error handling, streaming, CI/CD, infra as code, rate limiting, token cost controls.


Clear separation of concerns between API and UI, with modern tooling (FastAPI + Next.js + Tailwind).
Simple LLM integration that is easy to iterate on (OpenAI/Anthropic/HF Inference).
Developer‑friendly local run story (uvicorn / `npm run dev`). 
Minimal validation and error normalization across API responses.
Lack of streaming (SSE/websocket) and cancellation control for long LLM calls.
Missing observability (structured logs, traces, metrics) and cost tracking for LLM usage. 

2) Backend (FastAPI) Review
 
Expected good: Pydantic models, typed routes, service/layout split (`routers/`, `services/`, `schemas/`, `core/`).  
Gaps to check: docstrings, module‑level comments, consistent typing, `settings.py` via Pydantic Settings, `httpx` with timeouts/retries, central exception handlers.

Adherence to Stack Requirements: 
Backend: Python and FastAPI  
Frontend: Next.js &TailwindCSS   
LLM: any working provider (Gemini is the assumption)

Technical Implementation
API endpoints to accept a question, optional context, and return an answer.  
Frontend chat UI with Tailwind, minimal state management.  
Optional RAG (vector DB) if implemented.

Error Handling:
Look for: a `@app.exception_handler` for `HTTPException` and generic exceptions.

Plus client‑side surfacing with toasts. 

3) Product Management Perspective — Improvements
 Improvement 1: Input validation & limit
 Improvement 2: Unified error model & retries
 Improvement 3: Streaming responses & cancel
 Improvement 4: Observability & cost telemetry
 Improvement 5: Prompt and output safeguards
 Improvement 6: CI/CD and environment parity

4) Production Deployment Planning
 Scalability (1k+ concurrent users)
 Bottlenecks: LLM latency and API concurrency.
 Cost Optimisation:
 Prompt trimming and context windows; use conversation memory sparingly.  
 Monitoring & Analytics (KPIs)
 Latency: p50/p95 end‑to‑end, LLM time, queue time.  
 Reliability: error rate by code, timeout rate, vendor failure rate.  
 Quality: answer acceptance, thumbs up/down, re‑ask rate, hallucination flags.  
 Cost: tokens in/out, $ per request/user/segment, cache hit rate.  
 Growth: DAU/WAU, session length, retention, feature usage.  
 Ops: saturation (CPU/mem), open sockets, queue depth, worker restarts

5) Developer Feedback & Mentoring (150–200 words)
The chosen stack is a modern, sensible stack and got the core loop working. The next leap is moving from demo to product. Focus on inputs, errors, and visibility. Move prompts out of code, version them, and add lightweight output validation to reduce formatting errors. On the frontend,surface error states clearly and keep the chat UI responsive while tokens stream. For growth, set up CI to run linting, type checks, and a few high‑value tests on every PR, then ship with a minimal Dockerized pipeline. As next steps, build an analytics page to track costs and user behavior, then revisit model routing to balance quality and price. This work aligns with Pawa IT’s goals: reliable AI experiences that are measurable, affordable, and easy to iterate.


6) Sprint Planning — Next Assignment
Build a simple analytics dashboard for AI conversation metrics

It exercises both sides of the stack without deep third‑party dependencies. Deliverables:  
Backend: `/metrics` service and `/admin/analytics` API returning aggregates (requests/day, p95 latency, tokens/$ per user, error buckets).  
Storage: Postgres table for request logs (id, ts, user_id, model, tokens_in/out, latency_ms, status, cached:boolean).  
Frontend: Next.js page with charts (Recharts/Chart.js), filters by date/model/user.  
Ops: Prometheus exporter and a Grafana board for ops metrics.

Success here proves ownership of reliability and cost, and sets the baseline for future feature work (chatbot improvements, RAG, rate limiting).
